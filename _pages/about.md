I am a PhD student in [Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory (PNL)](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/pnl/) at The Ohio State University, in the department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I am advised by Professor [DeLiang Wang](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/). I received my bachelor's degree, Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.), in Electrical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](http://www.iith.ac.in/).

 
I am broadly interested in speech enhancement/separation, robust automatic speech recognition, machine learning and deep learning.
